# LINFO2275 – Data Mining and Decision Making  
Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) – Academic Year 2024–2025

This repository contains the two main projects completed as part of the **LINFO2275 – Data Mining and Decision Making** course. The course focuses on intelligent algorithms, decision theory, and applied machine learning techniques.

## Projects

### 1. Optimal Strategy for Snakes and Ladders *(MDP & Q-Learning)*  
This project models a stochastic version of the Snakes and Ladders game as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to compute optimal dice-selection strategies. A Q-learning implementation is also provided for comparison. The game includes probabilistic traps and bonuses.

### 2. 3D Hand Gesture Classification *(Machine Learning & Deep Learning)*  
This project compares several methods for classifying 3D hand gestures, including baseline approaches (KNN with custom distances) and advanced models (LSTM, HMM, DenseNet). The study evaluates performance under user-dependent and user-independent conditions.
